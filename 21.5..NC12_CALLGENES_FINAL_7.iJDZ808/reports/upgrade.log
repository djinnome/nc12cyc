[Slot COMMENT in Hemicelluloses changed
from   ("Please note that hemicellulose is a not a precise biological term.

The plant cell wall is composed of |FRAME: CELLULOSE| and many additional complex polymers.
Unlike cellulose, which is crystalline and resistant to hydrolysis, the other polymers are amorphous and are easily hydrolyzed by dilute acid or base.

Hemicellulose is a heterogenious term that is used for all the plant cell wall components that are soluble in dilute alkali solutions, or that go into solution quite readily in hot dilute mineral acids with the formation of simple sugars. The term is often used to describe all the polysaccharide components of the cell wall other than cellulose.

Hemicelluloses constitute about one-fourth of perennial plants and about one-third of annual plants. Since the term does not refer to a particular chemical entity, hemicelluloses extracted from different plant sources are rarely identical. 
However, D-Xylose is the dominant building unit of the hemicelluloses of most woods and annual plants. D-xylose occurs as the polymer |FRAME: Xylans|, as derivatives of xylan, such as |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans| and |FRAME: Arabinoxylan|, and as side chains on other types of backbones, such as |FRAME: Xyloglucan| and |FRAME: Xylogalacturonan|.
D-Mannose is also very abundant, and occurs as the polymer |FRAME: Mannan| or in combination with D-glucose or D-galactose as |FRAME: Glucomannans|, |FRAME: Galactomannans galactomannan|, or |FRAME: Galactoglucomannans galactoglucomannan|. Arabinose is common as well, either in the form of |FRAME: Arabinans \"L-arabinan\"| or in the form of side chains on other polysaccharides.

The secondary hydroxyl groups on xylose carbons 2 and 3 can be substituted by a number of residues, the type and degree of substitution depending on xylan's botanical source.

PKSs can be divided to two types: multifunctional polyproteins (type I) and discrete protein (type II).
Type I PKSs are organized into modular complexes, each catalyzing individual chain elongation steps using an associated carrier protein. The minimal type I PKS module consists of 3 domains: a ketosynthase, a acyltransferase, and an acyl-carrier protein (ACP). The acyltransferase domain catalyzes the priming of the flanking ACP domain with the appropriate substrate.

|CITS: [6354265]|. The citrate molecule is very stable, and needs to be activated prior to cleavage by
forming a thioester bond with the enzyme.

The enzyme is a complex of three subunits (in a 6:6:6 configuration), one of them a dedicated acyl carrier protein (acp).
It is synthesized in an apo form, and is converted to its holo form by the covalent binding of the unusual prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to the [acp] component, resulting in |FRAME: DEACETYL-CITRATE-LYASE|. However, this holo form is still not fully active - in order to be active, the prosthetic group needs to be acetylated, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: G6344|-encoded |FRAME: CITC-MONOMER|, which generates |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|.

The &alpha; subunit of the |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| is a citrate-[acp] transferase that catalyzes the exchange of the bound acetyl group with a citrate molecule, generating |FRAME: Citrate-Lyase-Citryl-Forms| and releasing an |FRAME: ACET| molecule.
The &beta; subunit, which is a citryl-[acp] lyase, catalyzes the subsequent step, cleaving the bound citryl group, releasing |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and regenerating |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|. Since the active form is regenrated, the enzyme can continuously catalyze the cleavage reaction.")

isofunctional with ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal
electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.

Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron
flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows
ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity.
Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR).
The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by
|FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.

Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism,
sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of
iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of

Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.

Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.")

The protein contains several domains, and different domains are involved in tRNA modification and thiazole formation. The THUMP and AANH domains are required for tRNA modification, while the only domain necessary for thiozole formation is the C-terminal rhodanese domain (as shown for the enzyme from Salmonella |CITS: [21724998]|).

Regarding thiazole biosynthesis, it has been shown that the thiI gene plays an essential role in the formation of a thiocarboxylate on the carboxylic acid group of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of the ThiS protein. ThiS isolated
from a thiI-defficient strain does not contain this modification |CITS: [9632726]|.

Regarding uridine modification, the enzyme adenylates the tRNA uridine and transfers sulfur from a persulfide formed on the protein. It is specific for the U8 residue of tRNA; the substrate specificity appears to be conferred by the secondary and tertiary structure of tRNA |CITS: [15037613]|.
The ThiI protein, but not the IscS protein, was shown to interact with tRNA.  <i>In vitro</i> studies using radiolabelled sulfur showed transfer of sulfur from IscS to ThiI; if tRNA is included, the sulfur appears to be incorporated into the tRNA in a ThiI- and ATP-dependent manner.  Based on these results, a model for mobilization and transfer of sulfur from cysteine via IscS and ThiI to U8 of tRNA has been presented |CITS: [10753862]|.")

The THUMP and AANH domains are required for tRNA modification, while the only domain necessary for thiozole formation is the C-terminal rhodanese domain (as shown for the enzyme from Salmonella |CITS: [21724998]|).

Regarding thiazole biosynthesis, it has been shown that the thiI gene plays an essential role in the formation of a thiocarboxylate on the carboxylic acid group of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of the ThiS protein. ThiS isolated
from a thiI-defficient strain does not contain this modification |CITS: [9632726]|.

Regarding uridine modification, the enzyme adenylates the tRNA uridine and transfers sulfur from a persulfide formed on the protein. It is specific for the U8 residue of tRNA; the substrate specificity appears to be conferred by the secondary and tertiary structure of tRNA |CITS: [15037613]|.
The ThiI protein, but not the IscS protein, was shown to interact with tRNA.  <i>In vitro</i> studies using radiolabelled sulfur showed transfer of sulfur from IscS to ThiI; if tRNA is included, the sulfur appears to be incorporated into the tRNA in a ThiI- and ATP-dependent manner.  Based on these results, a model for mobilization and transfer of sulfur from cysteine via IscS and ThiI to U8 of tRNA has been presented |CITS: [10753862]|.")

Updated slotunit  RXN-LOCATIONS, facet :DOCUMENTATION --> ("This slot is used for storing information about the metabolite compartments of a reaction,
in the case where non-default compartments are involved.  The default compartment is
defined as CCO-CYTOSOL.  There are two cases of reactions:

- S: Reactions that have all of their metabolites in the same compartment.

- T: Reactions that have metabolites in multiple compartments.
     This can only happen at membranes, involving transport reactions
     or electron transfer reactions (ETRs).  These reactions may use only the
     generic directional compartments CCO-IN and CCO-OUT for their metabolites,
     which need to be mapped to the actual compartments in a given PGDB for certain operations.

The values of this slot differ between these cases.

- S: If this reaction occurs in a non-default compartment, or in several compartments,
      then this slot stores for every compartment the corresponding frame (a child of CCO-SPACE).
      In cases where this slot contains a value, and the reaction occurs in the cytosol, then
      CCO-CYTOSOL must be included as a slot value.

- T: RXN-LOCATIONS contains one or more frames that are children of
     CCO-MEMBRANE , or potentially symbols that have to be unique in this slot,
     for situations where the metabolites are in spaces that are not directly adjacent
     to one membrane, or when 3 spaces are involved (such as if the transporter spans
     two membranes).  If the reaction was not assigned
     to any particular membrane, then no value is stored.

     Additionally, each slot value in RXN-LOCATIONS will have
     annotations with the labels CCO-IN and CCO-OUT, and in the case
     of 3 compartments involved, also another label called CCO-MIDDLE.
     The values of each of these annotations have to be one valid child of
     CCO-SPACE.  These annotations define the mappings between
     the COMPARTMENT annotation values, which the metabolites have that
     are listed in the reaction's LEFT and RIGHT slots, and the final
     compartments in this PGDB.

     Every metabolite in the reaction's LEFT and RIGHT slots needs to
     have a COMPARTMENT annotation, the value of which needs to be one
     of CCO-IN, CCO-OUT, or possibly CCO-MIDDLE in complex situations.

If the reaction is catalyzed by more than one enzyme (i.e. it has more
than one enzymatic-reaction attached), then each value in the
RXN-LOCATIONS slot has to have an annotation called ENZRXNS, which has
as its values the frame IDs of the corresponding enzymatic-reactions.
This allows determining the precise compartment(s) in which the
catalyzed reaction is occurring.

Whenever a reaction is transferred between PGDBs (by import or schema
upgrade operations), all values in the RXN-LOCATIONS are filtered away
(i.e. _not_ copied).  This prevents inapplicable compartments from
being introduced into other PGDBs.

Ideally, we would set the :Value-Type of RXN-LOCATIONS to be CCO-SPACE
in the Reactions class, and to be CCO-MEMBRANE for Transport-Reactions.
However, because some reactions are classified under both classes, this
approach does not work because depending on the order of parent traversal,
the facet computation might return CCO-SPACE for some transport reactions.
So, we simply give a :Value-Type of (:OR CCO-SPACE CCO-MEMBRANE :SYMBOL)
in Reactions.  :SYMBOL is required in the case of electron transport reactions that
span multiple membranes.
